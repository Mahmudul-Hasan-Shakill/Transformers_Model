## Transformers Model
Transformers provides APIs to easily download and train state-of-the-art pretrained models. Using pretrained models can reduce your compute costs, carbon footprint, and save you time from training a model from scratch. The models can be used across different modalities such as:

- 📝 **Text**: text classification, information extraction, question answering, summarization, translation, and text generation in over 100 languages.
- 🖼️ **Images**: image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
- 🗣️ **Audio**: speech recognition and audio classification.
- 🐙 **Multimodal**: table question answering, optical character recognition, information extraction from scanned documents, video classification, and visual question answering.
